This repository's goal is to study the **coordination of a robot fleet** using **ROS2**. We will study different architectures to achieve a specific scenario, and compare them based on different criteria.


## Scenario

We want to be able to control an **heterogenous fleet of robots** (for example robots from different vendors).

First, we'll consider that all the robots evolve in a known map. The operator would be able to send a goal pose, and an auction/bid system would assign the task to only one of the robots (based on its position and its waypoints queue). This auction system could either be centralized, with an entity listening all the bids and choosing the best one, or distributed, with each robot comparing its bid with the others.

As a bonus, it would be interesting to see how well the architecture is able to adapt to new robots dynamically added to the fleet or robot failures.

At the end, it would also be interesting to study how the fleet could share information to create a common map with multi robot SLAM algorithms.


## Comparison criteria

To compare the different methods, we'll use different criteria :

- **Dynamism :** Does the architecture allow to dynamically add a robot to the fleet ? (dynamic identification...)
- **Resilience :** Does the architecture continue to work when there are failures (of the robots or the operator) ? 
- **Reliability :** Are there losses in the communication ?
- **Isolation :** Are robot specific informations shared or kept local ? How much control do we have over the information shared ?
- **Network usage :** How much data is transfered on the network ?
- **Scalability :** Does the system still work well when there are lots of robots ?
- **Computability :** Does the system require a lot of computing power (both on the robots and the operator) ?
- **Ease of simulation :** How easy is it to reproduce this communication architecture in a simulation ?
- **Ease of programming :** Does this architecture require the programmer to make a lot of configuration on each robot to allow them to communicate ?


## Architectures

Here is the list of the different architectures we will study :

### Working

- Namespacing
- Different domain IDs (centralized or distributed)
- DDS Discovery servers (centralized or distributed)

### Promising

- [DDS partitions](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Tutorials/Advanced/FastDDS-Configuration.html#using-partitions-within-the-topic) for each topic
- [Security](https://github.com/ros2/sros2/blob/master/SROS2_Windows.md) inside ROS2 to prevent communication if no certificate

### Ideas to check

- [DDS domain tag](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.1/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/Content/UsersManual/ChoosingDomainTag.htm) (only CycloneDDS) that drops messages from the same DOMAIN_ID if nodes don't have the same domain tag
    > Is it possible for a node to be on multiple `tag` at the same time / switch when publishing ?
- *Modifying to the DDS RMW implementations to get access to Publisher/Subscriber and modify partitions dynamically (see [this](https://discourse.ros.org/t/restricting-communication-between-robots/2931/31))*

### Others

- Custom communication outside of ROS2 :
    > MQTT, Lora, Zigbee, Zenoh, ad hoc multi-hop with babel protocol

- Hubs ?? (see [this][1])



## State of the art notes

### Network types
- Local : works ok but compromise between distance an range and bandwidth/delay, especially with an important number of robots
- Cellular : works ok, even with lots of robots, but costly and less configurable
- Peer-to-peer : cools but still recent -> harder to find equipment
    - 4G LTE Device-to-Device (D2D) allows local communication
    - 5G Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), centralized or decentralized

### Simulators
- [MAES](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10015-023-00895-7) : multirobots simulator made with Unity, but maximum 5 robots via ROS2
- [Stage](https://github.com/tuw-robotics/stage_ros2/tree/humble)
- [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/)

- *Argos : simulator with ROS1 bridge but not ROS2*
